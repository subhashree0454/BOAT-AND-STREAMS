To find the speed of the boat in still water, we can use the information given about rowing downstream and upstream.

### Given:
- Time to row downstream = 2 hours
- Time to row upstream = 3 hours
- Velocity of the stream = 4 km/h

### Step 1: Calculate the distance

Let the distance be \( D \). Since speed = distance/time, we can express the distance:

1. **Downstream speed**:
   \[
   \text{Speed}_{\text{down}} = \frac{D}{2}
   \]

2. **Upstream speed**:
   \[
   \text{Speed}_{\text{up}} = \frac{D}{3}
   \]

### Step 2: Set up the equations for speed

Let \( B \) be the speed of the boat in still water. The effective speeds can be expressed as:

1. **Downstream**:
   \[
   \frac{D}{2} = B + 4
   \]

2. **Upstream**:
   \[
   \frac{D}{3} = B - 4
   \]

### Step 3: Equate the distances

From the first equation:
\[
D = 2(B + 4)
\]

From the second equation:
\[
D = 3(B - 4)
\]

Setting these equal to each other:
\[
2(B + 4) = 3(B - 4)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( B \)

Expanding both sides:
\[
2B + 8 = 3B - 12
\]
\[
8 + 12 = 3B - 2B
\]
\[
20 = B
\]

### Final Answer:

The speed of the boat in still water is **20 km/h**.
