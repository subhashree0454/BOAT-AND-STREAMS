To find the speed of the boat in still water, we can use the speeds given for downstream and upstream.

### Given:
- Speed along the stream (downstream) = 11 km/h
- Speed against the stream (upstream) = 5 km/h

### Step 1: Set up the equations

Let:
- Speed of the boat in still water = \( B \) km/h
- Speed of the current = \( C \) km/h

From the given speeds, we can set up the following equations:

1. **Downstream**:
   \[
   B + C = 11 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

2. **Upstream**:
   \[
   B - C = 5 \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the equations

Adding equations (1) and (2):
\[
(B + C) + (B - C) = 11 + 5
\]
\[
2B = 16
\]
\[
B = 8 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Final Answer:

**C. 8 km/h**
