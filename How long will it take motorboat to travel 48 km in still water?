To find out how long the motorboat will take to travel 48 km in still water, let's analyze the given information.

### Given:

1. **Against the flow**: 
   - Distance = 16 km
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Speed against the flow = \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) km/h

2. **Along the flow**: 
   - Distance = 8 km
   - Time = 20 minutes = \(\frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3}\) hours
   - Speed along the flow = \(\frac{8}{\frac{1}{3}} = 24\) km/h

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the current

Let \( B \) be the speed of the boat in still water and \( C \) be the speed of the current.

From the calculations:
1. **Against the flow**:
   \[
   B - C = 8 \text{ km/h}
   \]

2. **Along the flow**:
   \[
   B + C = 24 \text{ km/h}
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

Adding the two equations:
\[
(B - C) + (B + C) = 8 + 24
\]
\[
2B = 32 \Rightarrow B = 16 \text{ km/h}
\]

Substituting \( B \) back into one of the equations to find \( C \):
\[
16 - C = 8 \Rightarrow C = 8 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate time to travel 48 km in still water

Using the speed of the boat in still water:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{48}{16} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:

**3 hours**
