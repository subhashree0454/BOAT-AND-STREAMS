To find the man's rate along the current, we can use the information given about his speed in still water and against the current.

### Given:
- Speed in still water \( B = 5 \) km/h
- Speed against the current \( B - C = 3.5 \) km/h

### Step 1: Find the speed of the current \( C \)

Using the equation for speed against the current:
\[
B - C = 3.5
\]
Substituting \( B = 5 \):
\[
5 - C = 3.5
\]
\[
C = 5 - 3.5 = 1.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the speed along the current

Using the equation for speed along the current:
\[
B + C = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Final Answer:

**C. 6.5 km/h**
