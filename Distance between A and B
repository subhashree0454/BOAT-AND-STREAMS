To determine the distance between A and B, we can use the information provided about the boat's speed and the time taken for the round trip.

### Given:
- Velocity of the boat in still water, \( B = 4 \) km/h.
- Total time for the round trip (A to B and back) = 3 hours.

### Step 1: Define the speed of the current

Let the speed of the current be \( C \) km/h. The effective speeds are:
- Downstream (A to B): \( B + C = 4 + C \)
- Upstream (B to A): \( B - C = 4 - C \)

### Step 2: Set up the equations

The total time for the round trip can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{D}{B + C} + \frac{D}{B - C} = 3
\]

Where \( D \) is the distance between A and B.

### Step 3: Combine the expressions

Using a common denominator, we can write:
\[
\frac{D(B - C) + D(B + C)}{(B + C)(B - C)} = 3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{D(2B)}{(B + C)(B - C)} = 3
\]
Thus,
\[
D(2B) = 3(B + C)(B - C)
\]

### Step 4: Calculate with \( C = 0 \)

If we assume there is no current for simplicity:
1. When \( C = 0 \):
   \[
   D = 3 \times 4 \text{ km/h} = 12 \text{ km}
   \]

### Final Answer:

**12 km**
