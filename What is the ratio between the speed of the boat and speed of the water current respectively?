To find the ratio between the speed of the boat and the speed of the water current, let's denote:

- Speed of the boat in still water = \( B \) km/h
- Speed of the current = \( C \) km/h

### Given:

- Time taken upstream = 9 hours 48 minutes = \( 9 + \frac{48}{60} = \frac{588}{60} = \frac{49}{5} \) hours
- Time taken downstream = 7 hours

### Step 1: Set up the equations for speed

Let the distance be \( D \). Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):

1. **Upstream**:
   \[
   D = (B - C) \times \frac{49}{5}
   \]

2. **Downstream**:
   \[
   D = (B + C) \times 7
   \]

### Step 2: Set the two expressions for distance equal

Setting the two equations for distance equal:
\[
(B - C) \times \frac{49}{5} = (B + C) \times 7
\]

### Step 3: Expand and simplify

Expanding both sides:
\[
\frac{49}{5}B - \frac{49}{5}C = 7B + 7C
\]

Multiplying through by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
49B - 49C = 35B + 35C
\]

### Step 4: Rearranging the equation

Rearranging gives:
\[
49B - 35B = 49C + 35C
\]
\[
14B = 84C
\]

Dividing both sides by 14:
\[
B = 6C
\]

### Step 5: Find the ratio

The ratio of the speed of the boat to the speed of the current:
\[
\frac{B}{C} = \frac{6C}{C} = 6:1
\]

### Final Answer:

**C. 6:1**
