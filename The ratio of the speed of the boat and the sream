To find the ratio of the speed of the boat in still water to the speed of the stream, let:

- Speed of the boat in still water = \( B \) km/h
- Speed of the stream = \( C \) km/h

### Given Condition:

The man takes twice as long to row against the stream as he does downstream.

### Step 1: Set up the time equations

1. **Time taken to row downstream**:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{down}} = \frac{D}{B + C}
   \]

2. **Time taken to row upstream**:
   \[
   \text{Time}_{\text{up}} = \frac{D}{B - C}
   \]

According to the problem:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{up}} = 2 \times \text{Time}_{\text{down}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for time:
\[
\frac{D}{B - C} = 2 \times \frac{D}{B + C}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation

Cancelling \( D \) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{B - C} = \frac{2}{B + C}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
B + C = 2(B - C)
\]

### Step 3: Rearranging the equation

Expanding:
\[
B + C = 2B - 2C
\]
\[
B + 3C = 2B
\]
\[
B = 3C
\]

### Step 4: Find the ratio

The ratio of the speed of the boat to the speed of the stream is:
\[
\frac{B}{C} = \frac{3C}{C} = 3:1
\]

### Final Answer:

**B. 3 : 1**
